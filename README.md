The voice-controlled Arduino car is interfaced with a Bluetooth module HC-05. We can give specific voice commands to the car through an Android app installed on the phone. At the receiving side, a Bluetooth transceiver module receives the commands and forwards them to the Arduino and thus the car is controlled.

Components Required:
  1	Arduino UNO Board
  2	HC-05 Bluetooth Module
  3	DC Motors 9V	2	Amazon
  4	9V Battery	1	Amazon
  5	Connecting Wires
  6	Breadboard

You will see 4 blank connection in circuit's breadboard (R2-C3,R2-C4,R2-C5,R2-C6) add HC-05 there.
